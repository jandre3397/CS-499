  Enhanced with a graphical interface and cross-platform usability.  

- **AVL Tree Project (C++)**  
  Improved version of the original BST, updated with self-balancing logic for efficiency.

  Transformed into a full-stack web app using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, with real-time updates and a modern UI.
