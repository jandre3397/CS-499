# Original Artifacts  

This folder contains the **original versions** of my CS-499 Capstone artifacts.  
These projects were developed earlier in the Computer Science program before enhancement in the capstone.

## Included Original Projects
- **ABCU Course Advising System (C++)**  
  A console-based program using a hash table to manage course information and prerequisites.  

- **Binary Search Tree Project (C++)**  
  A tree structure built to store and search municipal auction data, with insertion, traversal, and deletion functions.  

- **Animal Shelter Dashboard (Python + MongoDB)**

These original versions serve as the foundation for my enhanced artifacts, showing where I began before improving them for the capstone project.
