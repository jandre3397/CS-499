# Enhanced Artifacts  

This folder contains the **enhanced versions** of my CS-499 Capstone artifacts.  
These projects were improved during the capstone to demonstrate growth in software engineering, algorithms, databases, and professional presentation.

## Enhanced Projects
- **ABCU Course Advising System (Python + Tkinter GUI)**  
  Rebuilt from C++ into Python with a graphical interface. Demonstrates skills in language translation, modular design, and user experience.  

- **AVL Tree Project (C++)**  
  Enhanced from a basic Binary Search Tree into a self-balancing AVL Tree. Highlights knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and efficiency improvements.  

- **Animal Shelter Dashboard (MERN Stack)**  
  Transformed from a Python/MongoDB Jupyter Notebook into a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) web application. Demonstrates full-stack development, modern web design, and database integration.
